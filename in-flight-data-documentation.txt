Data collected in-flight from the rocket according to CDR Data Analysis Plan:


• Altitude (over time) utilizing an altimeter
• altitude (using the altimeter, barometer, GPS tracker, and internal clock)


• speed – calculations based on data of the 1-axis accelerometer, GPS tracker, altimeter, and internal clock


• Level of flight stability (over time) with 3-axis gyros
• stablility of flight  – using the power consumption and rotational rate of the gyroscopes


• Acceleration (over time) in the main flight axis with a 1-axis accelerometer
• Acceleration (over time) in three spatial axis using a a 3 axis-accelerometer


• flight path  – using the GPS tracker and altitude sensors, and internal clock
• Position according to the Earth’s magnetic field (over time) using a 3-axis magnetic sensor
• Flight position (over time) using a GPS sensors


• external parameters – using barometer, hygrometer, and thermal sensors (in-flight and on ground) as well as wind speed meter (on ground)
• Atmospheric pressure (over time) using a barometric sensor


• Energy consumption (over time) with energy sensors at different systems


• Internal temperature (over time) of several rocket systems
